### How to Use This README:
1. Save as `README.md` in your project folder.
2. Replace the placeholder image link with an actual screenshot (upload an image to your repo and link it).
3. Customize sections (like "Future Improvements") as needed.
4. Push to GitHubâ€”it will automatically render on your repo page.

This provides clear instructions, explains the code, and encourages contributions. Would you like me to add anything specific, like installation troubleshooting or credit sections?
